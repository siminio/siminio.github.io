Welcome to my blog.

I created this blog because there are a lot of great resources to lean Haskell like <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn you Haskell</a> but not so many resources to learn to practice it. In this blog, I explain how I solved Codingame puzzles using Haskell.
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.codingame.com">Codingame</a> is a great website where you can use your favorite programming language and solve puzzles or particapate in online programming contests.
<br><br>
What I recommend you is to try to solve a Codingame puzzle. No matter you succeeded or not you can after see how I solved it. I hope you will learn a lot thanks to this method.
<br><br>
The list of puzzles that I solved are :
<ul>
	<li><a href="/Mars-Landers-Ep1/">Mars Landers Ep1</a></li>
	<li><a href="/Power-of-Thor/">Power of Thor</a></li>
	<li><a href="/Horse-Racing-Duals">Horse Racing Duals</a></li>
</ul>
